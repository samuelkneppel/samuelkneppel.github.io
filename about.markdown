# Sam Kneppel, CISSP

As a Cyber Security Engineer with a CISSP certification and a BS in Information Technology from New Jersey Institute of Technology, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the field of cyber security. My tenure as a Senior Security Analyst at Everest in Warren, NJ has provided me with skills in intrusion detection, threat mitigation, incident response, and threat hunting. I have successfully recognized and mitigated potential intrusion attempts and contained identified threats using approved incident response methodologies. I have also been involved in implementing security policy changes and conducting malware analysis. One of my key projects was migrating over 3700 end-user Windows devices from McAfee Endpoint Security to Windows Defender. I have experience with AWS, Azure, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft SCCM, and Windows Defender for Endpoint. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong leader and communicator, having provided mentorship to junior analysts and worked closely with cross-functional teams within Cybersecurity. I am dedicated to continuously learning and improving my skills to provide top-notch cyber security solutions.
